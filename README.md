# Patent--IoT-Based-Automatic-Pollination-for-Vertical-Framing
Vertical farming is the cultivation of vegetables in layers that are piled vertically. We artificially manage the light, temperature, water system, and other beneficial variables in a controlled environment. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, with the global population predicted to surpass 9 billion by 2050, it would be necessary to increase food production by at least 70 percent. In this case, vertical farming may be revered as a solution capable of resolving the "food desert" problem. However, one of the most significant disadvantages of vertical farming is the absence of natural pollination, which is accomplished in conventional farming with the aid of wind, bees, insects, and other variables, because it is conducted in a controlled setting. Therefore, it must be performed manually, which is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive.

Therefore, to overcome this difficulty our invention has developed an IoT device which will automatically detect the flower and using soft vibration pollinate the flower and move to next flower. In this way, we will reduce the time and money for both farmers and those who depend on vertical farming.
